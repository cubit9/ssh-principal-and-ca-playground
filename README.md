( This is a work in progress! )


## Getting Started

- `./bin/create-keys.sh` - Create our SSH keys.


## Development

- `./bin/clean.sh` - Kill all containers (or an existing container, if specified), remove them, (re)build them, and start them back up.
- `./bin/attach.sh` - Attach to any running container.
- `./bin/clean-and-attach.sh` - Nice wrapper script for the previous two commands. :-)
- `./bin/logs.sh` - Display logs from all containers, or a single container if specified.
